# This file consolidates all RUSTSEC advisory exceptions in one place.
# These are known vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies that cannot be
# easily upgraded, typically due to deep dependency chains (e.g., wasmtime).

[advisories]
# No longer needed - wasmtime updated to v41, ratatui to v0.30
ignore = []

# Warn on informational advisories (unmaintained, unsound, etc.)
